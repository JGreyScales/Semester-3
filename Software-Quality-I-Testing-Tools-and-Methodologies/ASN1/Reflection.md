## My Reflection
I decided to recreate this project from complete scratch, instead of using the existing codebase

I used the class structure & redesigned the project from the ground up, I first started by making flowchart.png (which is not representitive of the final product)

From there I began to define my classes, specifically what properties each class would have, this information was stored & updated in requirements.md (which is not representitive of the final product)

Finally, I revisited my flowchart in detailedflowchart.png (not representivie of the final product), Although this specific PNG is mostly useless & is not of quality, during the development of this PNG I was able to fully realize my goals, my methods, and my properties of all classes

I then revisted my requirements.MD & added all my methods, their inputs & their outputs. At this point I had the entire project mapped & fully idealized

Then I wrote all my test cases using my requirements.MD as a reference. With this I was able to write every single test case

And then finally I wrote my code, ran my tests, fixed my code, ran my tests, etc etc, until 100% test success rate (this is all logged in CoffeeOrder.Tests/TestResults)

## Start

I started this project by using a .MD file to define the purpose, methods, properties, relationships of all classes before even writing tests or code.

Typically, In the past I've written the main file & then expanded outwards, but having the entire project realized before begining production allowed me to optimize my time

See completion %'s to predict how long the project would take & optimize my time by adding new or removing old features that would not be met in time.

I ran into very little issues, the only issues I ran into were because I was somewhat unfamiliar with the testing process of this language & some syntax stuff.

But the logical core of the program had zero issues during writing & I attribute all of this success to the described above

## Stop

Trying to micro-optimize every line of code. While useful for production ready code or a refactor, considering that I built this project from the ground up

I spent more time trying to micro-optimize every line of code, when the code did not need to be optimized. In total, I think on a single automated run of the program, I save like 0.04 seconds.

Which is great, but I need to understand my scopes & customer requirements stronger to optimize my time efficiency 

## Continue

Breaking everything down into its own objects & classes, something that I personally feel I've always excelled at. 

By breaking everything down into their own classes, even if they only have a few methods / properties it makes it alot easier to read the code, removes the concept of magic variables

and allows future expandability / stronger async teamwork to be deployed
