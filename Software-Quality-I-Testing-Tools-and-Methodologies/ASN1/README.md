## Execute Tests
``dotnet test``

## Execute Program - executed from the ASN1 dir
``dotnet run --project .\CoffeeOrder\``


## My pending tests are underneath of the ReceiptFormatterTEST.cs
### ReceiptFormatterTEST.cs must not be parralized due to the streamwriters
these tests are intended to fail & to show my ability to write tests before code infrastructure exists for said tests
